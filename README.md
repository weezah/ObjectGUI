# ObjectGUI
A in-game object value editor for Unity

Unity offers a fantastic editor. When working on projects that target tablets and mobile devices we often have the need to change and tweak parameters at run time whithout having to re-deploy the whole project.

These scripts offer this functionality. Using the legacy GUI system they recreate a simplified version of the unity editor for a set of Monobehaviours accessible via the in-game UI.

## Usage

* ObjectGUIManager  
   Defines the UI area and the placement of the hidden toggle button

* ObjectGUI
   Contains the monobehaviour to be drawn
